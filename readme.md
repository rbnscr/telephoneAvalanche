# Background
In germany, the protagonists of the popular radio play _Die Drei ???_ sometimes use a so-called "telephone avalanche" - basically a chain letter - in order to receive critical information.
The three of them each call five of their friends, which in turn call some friends and so on - until someone's friend's friend has the desired information. Doubting the effectiveness of such procedure, I wrote a small python script. The rules are as follows:

# Rules for the caller
- You can only calls _once_ per simulation
- Do not call the person(s), who called you
